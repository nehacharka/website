              <p class="title">Web Developer</p>
              <p>Hey! My name is Neha Charka, and I'm currently a junior at The Ohio State University, 
                where I'm pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I have always been fascinated by the 
                intersection where functionality meets beauty, which naturally led them to the world of tech design. 
                Living off-campus has presented its own set of challenges, particularly when it comes to planning daily 
                meals amidst classes and work schedule. That's why Aly and I decided to create an innovative recipe 
                generator, designed to meet the needs of fellow college students who have a kitchen at their disposal 
                and are looking to prepare meals within a specific time frame and budget. </p>

              <h2>Aly Bannister</h2>
              <p class="title">Web Developer</p>
              <p> Hi! My name is Aly Bannister and I am a junior at Colgate University majoring in Computer Science 
                and minoring in Global Public and Environmental Health. I love discovering topics at the intersection 
                of health and technology, and that is why I am so excited about creating G00d F00d G00d M00d with Neha 
                through the help of Girls Who Code! As a college student living off-campus, it has been an adjustment
                 learning how to cook well for myself on a budget and with time constraints. Our goal is to make 
                 cooking and eating healthy easier for students like ourselves and create a community of people with 
                 delicious, nutritious new recipes! </p>
